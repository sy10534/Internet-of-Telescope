# Internet-of-Telescope
Open source project for Internet of Telescope 鏡聯網
<br>
For those who are looking for a cheap controller, and is willing to do a little tinkering.


## Behind the project:
I am a secondary school student from Hong Kong who loves exploring about astronomy, physics, engineering, and computer technologies. I started designing this system since the November of 2024, prices of asiair and onstep controller were unreasonably expensive in my perspective, so I thought maybe I could create a telescope control system by myself.
<br>
After careful discussion with my teachers, I decided it was the best to make the project open source for everyone in the Internet.

# Results:

## Competition
I was fortunate to obtain the champion in Hong Kong Youth Aerospace Innovation Competition (HKYAIC) 2024-2025, Telescope Designing and Research high school division.
<br><br>
I was given the chance to represent Hong Kong in the National Youth Aerospace Innovation Competition held in Hainan, but I dismissed the offer due to a crash with representing Hong Kong in International Olympiad of Astronomy and Astrophysics for participating the first time.

# Credits for equatorial mount:
Thank you Mr.DeepAddicted for open sourcing his DIY Keen One Equatorial Mount, I built my system based on his model. Without his open sourced mount, I couldn't have write the system.

Maybe you can modify my system and apply it on other DIY mounts too!

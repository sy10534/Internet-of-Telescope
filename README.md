# Internet-of-Telescope
Open source project for Internet of Telescope 鏡聯網

## Behind the project:
I am a student from Hong Kong who loves astronomy, physics, engineering, and computer technologies. I started designing this system since the November of 2024, prices of asiair and onstep controller were unreasonably expensive in my perspective, so I thought maybe I could create a telescope control system by myself.

## What I've learnt from this project:
to generalize it into a few fields

### data analysis

### engineering

### programming

### astronomy and astrophysics
inputting coordinates into IOT requires some transformation of coordinates, I understood a lot more on celestial sphere application after working on the system.


## Competition results:
I was fortunate to obtain the champion in Hong Kong Youth Aerospace Innovation Competition 2024-2025, Telescope Designing and Research high school division.

I was given the chance to represent Hong Kong in the National Youth Aerospace Innovation Competition held in Hainan, but I dismissed the offer due to a crash with representing Hong Kong in International Olympiad of Astronomy and Astrophysics for participating the first time.

# Internet-of-Telescope
Open source project for Internet of Telescope 鏡聯網

## Behind the project:
I am a secondary school student from Hong Kong who loves exploring about astronomy, physics, engineering, and computer technologies. I started designing this system since the November of 2024, prices of asiair and onstep controller were unreasonably expensive in my perspective, so I thought maybe I could create a telescope control system by myself.

After careful discussion with my teachers, I decided it was the best to make the project open source for everyone in the Internet.

## Competition results:
I was fortunate to obtain the champion in Hong Kong Youth Aerospace Innovation Competition 2024-2025, Telescope Designing and Research high school division.

I was given the chance to represent Hong Kong in the National Youth Aerospace Innovation Competition held in Hainan, but I dismissed the offer due to a crash with representing Hong Kong in International Olympiad of Astronomy and Astrophysics for participating the first time.

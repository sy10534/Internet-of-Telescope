# Internet-of-Telescope
Open source project for Internet of Telescope 鏡聯網

## Story of my project:
I am a student from Hong Kong who loves astronomy, physics, engineering, and ict tech.

## Competition results:
I was fortunate enough to obtain the champion in Hong Kong Youth Aerospace Innovation Competition 2024-2025, Telescope Designing and Research high school division.

I was given the chance to represent Hong Kong in the National Youth Aerospace Innovation Competition held in Hainan, but I dismissed the offer due to a crash with representing Hong Kong in International Olympiad of Astronomy and Astrophysics for participating the first time.
